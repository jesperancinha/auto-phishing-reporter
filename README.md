# auto-phishing-reporter
The goal of this repository is to create a tool which users can install as a service and with that, have their phishing emails automatically sent to whatever user map them to. I will only make an official release of this when I'm absolutely sure of a couple of things. One is that the wrong mail doesn't get emailed to a phishing reporting service and make sure that to the best of my knowledge, the phishing emails are reported by the minute you receive them. This will give pirates and hackers a lot less time be able to escape. All of this comfortably knowing that no script will be run from the emails received.
